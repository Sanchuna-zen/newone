## **Product Concept** 

An AI-powered Figma plugin that automates color palette application, proactively checks and enforces accessibility compliance in real time, and generates creative, brand-compliant color variations. The plugin is designed for both individual designers and enterprise teams, offering flexible workflows and rapid iteration to stay ahead of competitors. Its unique value lies in real-time, intelligent automation that saves time, ensures consistency, and supports creativityâ€”all while strictly adhering to brand and accessibility standards.

## **Specifications** 

### **ux-color-automation-panel**

**type**: ux
**scope**: Includes panel UI in Figma plugin, role-based color display, palette variant switching, live accessibility feedback, and override/revert controls. Excludes core AI engine and backend logic.
**title**: Color Automation Panel for Real-Time Palette Application
**spec_id**: ux-color-automation-panel
**priority**: must-have
**assumptions**:
- Figma plugin API supports real-time UI updates.
- Users will interact primarily through the panel for color management tasks.
**constraints**:
- Limited to Figma plugin UI capabilities and event hooks.
- Must not interfere with Figma's native interface.
**description**: The plugin must provide a dedicated Color Automation panel within the Figma UI, allowing users to view, manage, and preview color palette applications in real time. The panel should display role-based color assignments, palette variants, and live accessibility feedback. Users should be able to interactively select UI elements and instantly see automated color application results, with options to override or revert changes.
**business_rules**:
- Panel must remain consistent with Figma's design guidelines for plugins.
**specifications**:
- Panel must be dockable or easily accessible from Figma's plugin window.
- Display a list of detected UI elements and their assigned colors based on role (e.g., primary, accent, background).
- Show available color palette variants and allow switching between them.
- Live contrast and accessibility indicators must update as users preview changes.
- Override and revert controls must be clearly visible and easy to use.
**business_objective**: Streamline designer workflows and reduce manual effort in color management through an intuitive, real-time interface.
**exception_handling**:
- If Figma API fails to return UI element details, display a clear error message in the panel.
- If a user attempts to override a color assignment that violates brand guidelines, provide a warning and explain the constraint.
**validation_criteria**:
- The panel is accessible from the main Figma plugin interface.
- Users can view and interact with role-based color assignments and palette variants.
- Live feedback is provided on accessibility compliance as changes are made.
- Interactive preview and override/revert controls are available.
**business_justification**: Designers need a single, interactive panel to manage automated color application; current solutions are fragmented and require multiple steps, leading to inefficiency.

### **ux-role-based-color-preview**

**type**: ux
**scope**: Includes UI for role-based assignment, interactive preview, compliance warnings, and undo/redo. Excludes backend AI color suggestion logic.
**title**: Role-Based Color Preview and Interactive Assignment
**spec_id**: ux-role-based-color-preview
**priority**: must-have
**assumptions**:
- UI roles are clearly defined and mapped in project settings.
- Brand and accessibility rules are available for validation.
**constraints**:
- Must use Figma plugin events to update colors in real time.
- Performance must remain acceptable for large projects.
**description**: Users must be able to preview and interactively assign colors to UI elements based on their role (e.g., primary, secondary, accent, background, text) within the plugin interface. Visual feedback should show the impact of assignments in real time, both in the design canvas and in the Color Automation panel. Changes must be reversible, and users should be warned if assignments violate brand or accessibility rules.
**business_rules**:
- All color assignments must be checked against brand and WCAG/APCA rules before being committed.
**specifications**:
- Role-based color preview must be visually distinct and update in real time as users interact.
- Interactive assignment controls (drag-and-drop, dropdown, or similar) for each element or group.
- Visual indicators highlight when a role assignment is out of compliance (e.g., insufficient contrast, non-brand color).
- Undo/redo and revert options must be available for all assignments.
**business_objective**: Enable precise, compliant, and efficient color assignment by role within Figma.
**exception_handling**:
- If a user attempts to assign a non-compliant color, block the action and display an explanation.
**validation_criteria**:
- Users can preview color assignments by role before applying changes.
- Interactive assignment and reassignment is possible via the panel or directly on the canvas.
- Violations of brand or accessibility guidelines prompt clear warnings.
**business_justification**: Role-based color assignment is critical for brand and accessibility compliance, and current tools lack interactive, real-time assignment workflows.

### **ux-accessibility-feedback-indicators**

**type**: ux
**scope**: Includes UI indicators, actionable feedback, and auto-fix for accessibility in color assignment workflows.
**title**: Real-Time Accessibility Feedback and Indicators
**spec_id**: ux-accessibility-feedback-indicators
**priority**: must-have
**assumptions**:
- WCAG/APCA rules are consistently applied in plugin logic.
- Figma API allows for real-time updates of UI indicators.
**constraints**:
- Must update indicators with minimal latency for real-time experience.
- Compliance calculations must be accurate and up-to-date.
**description**: The plugin must display real-time accessibility feedback for all color assignments and palette changes. Accessibility indicators should be shown prominently in the UI, reflecting WCAG/APCA compliance status as designers interact with color assignments. Feedback must be actionable, offering suggestions or automated fixes when violations are detected.
**business_rules**:
- All color assignments must be checked for compliance before finalization.
**specifications**:
- Display a color contrast/compliance indicator next to each role assignment and color pairing in the panel.
- Indicators must update in real time as changes are made.
- Non-compliance must trigger actionable feedback: suggestions for compliant alternatives or a one-click auto-fix.
- Compliance status must be based on latest WCAG/APCA standards.
**business_objective**: Enable designers to achieve accessibility compliance as they work, reducing rework and risk of inaccessible designs.
**exception_handling**:
- If compliance cannot be calculated (e.g., missing data), display a warning and block the assignment.
**validation_criteria**:
- Accessibility indicators update instantly as color assignments change.
- WCAG/APCA compliance is clearly displayed for each element or color pair.
- Actionable suggestions or automated fixes are available for non-compliance.
**business_justification**: Manual post-design accessibility checks are inefficient and lead to compliance failures. Real-time feedback and correction prevent errors before they occur.
